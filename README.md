This implements bindings to SGI's libattr, which provides access to
extended attributes on Unix systems for filesystems that support
them. In particular, this provides access to extended attributes on
ext3/4 and xfs on Linux, HFS+ extended attributes on Mac OS X, as well
as other filesystems that support this interface. For more information
about extended attributes, see the man page for attr(5).

To build this code, you'll need to have the libattr development headers
installed. On Fedora/RHEL the package name is `libattr-devel`. On Debian/Ubuntu
the package name is `attr-dev`.

You can find the latest stable version of this code on
[HackageDB](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html). The bleeding-edge
version of the code is hosted at git://github.com/eklitzke/libattr-hs.git.
